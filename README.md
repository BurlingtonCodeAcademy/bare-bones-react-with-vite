# Bare Bones React with Vite

## Getting Started

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.
